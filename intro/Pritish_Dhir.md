                                                   Hello Team StatusNeo!!

My name is Pritish Dhir, and I am thrilled to join the Status Neo team. As someone deeply passionate about research, data analytics, 
and the dynamic field of data science, I am eager to contribute my expertise and enthusiasm to our collective endeavors.

My professional journey has been marked by a fervent interest in exploring the intricacies of data analytics and management, culminating in a specialization in AI/ML. I had the honor of presenting a paper at the esteemed EASCT 2023 conference, Titled - "Detection of Botrytis Cinerea In grapes using Machine Learning Techniques".

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am equally enthusiastic about staying informed about global geostationary and geopolitical affairs. This passion extends to my commitment to ongoing education and awareness in these crucial domains.

Moreover, I have a penchant for outdoor activities, particularly cycling and trekking. These pursuits not only invigorate me but also align with my belief in maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
         
I am eager to collaborate, learn, and contribute to Status Neo's remarkable endeavors. Please feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities or projects where my skills and interests could be of value.

Thank you for the warm welcome, and I look forward to meeting and working with each of you.

Warm regards,

Pritish Dhir
